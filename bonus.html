      <h5>Whom Shall I Fear (God of Angel Armies)</h5>
      <p class="note">A song by Chris Tomlin</p>

      <h5>The Story Behind It:</h5>

      <p class="small-column">I know sign language because I was born with 80-90 dB profound hearing loss. It came out of nowhere in my all-hearing family, and my mom prayed that one day I would be able to overcome my disability and be able to support myself with a job. 21 years later, even me having the opportunity to be at a world-class college, full of opportunities is a testament to God's awesome power and listening ears to hear our cries.</p>

      <p class="small-column">Growing up, I never felt comfortable using sign language and was embarrassed to sign around hearing folks, even to my interpreter in school. I also remember wanting to use my sign language during Church songs, but always feared doing that too.</p>

      <p class="small-column">A few years ago, at a powerful Christian conference called Passion, I first began to praise God through sign language in this very song, &quot;Whom Shall I Fear?&quot;</p>

      <p class="small-column">Ever since I let go of that fear, it has returned manifold blessings. One of which being this little joy of a sign language class that I get to teach, which in turn has brought joy to others.</p>

      <p class="small-column">And I think God works like this for everyone. When we realize the only way to overcome our fear is to surrender to Him, we let the God who created us come by our side, guiding us, protecting us, bringing Light to our lives and shining into the lives of those around us.</p>

      <p class="small-column">&quot;I know who goes before me...&quot; Looking back, time and time again I realize how God has always been forging the path ahead.</p>

      <p class="small-column">&quot;I know who stands behind...&quot; The more I let go of my own goals and wants, the more I see the things He has been preparing me for all my life, and I'm blown away every time.</p>

      <p class="small-column">&quot;Whom shall I fear?&quot; Nothing compares to the freedom we can have in Jesus.</p>

      <p class="small-column">May this video bless you.</p>

      <h5>The Story Behind It:</h5>

      <p class="small-column">This song is about hope - the kind of hope that goes beyond what we can see, beyond the pains we feel everyday, beyond the darkness of our fears.</p>

      <p class="small-column">Inside of us I think we all have a desire that burns for a place that no place in this world can ever satisfy.</p>

      <p class="small-column">I believe that place is real, but not yet here.  I believe one day all will be made right, and all will be made new.</p>

      <p class="small-column">This song represents for me the hope that even though this world is imperfect, and we are imperfect, on that day when heaven meets earth we will <br>&quot;burn bright, as we all unite&quot;<br>and we will<br>&quot;watch the sky, as it fills with light.&quot;</p>

      <p class="small-column">A day at the end of time <br>&quot;when all's said and done&quot;<br> and we will see God, when evil and pain will be forever finished, and when God will be with his people forever.</p>

      <p class="small-column">This is the hope that I have, like a flame that must be kept alive until that day when it can become truly bright.</p>

      <p class="small-column">A flame that calls me to endure and love and serve God and the people around me with thanksgiving and joy - a life lived from this hope, this faith, this fire.</p>

      <p class="small-column">Stay strong, friends.  If you share this hope with me, I encourage you, don't let the fire die.</p>

      <p class="small-column">I pray this small endeavour of a video may grant a glimpse of this beautiful hope and spark us towards a life that perseveres towards that day.</p>

      <p class="small-column">May this video fan in you a flame, a beautiful vision and reminder of hope.</p>

      <h5>Jesus, Only Jesus (and Crown Him [Majesty])</h5>
      <p class="note">A song by Passion, feat. Matt Redman (and Chris Tomlin)</p>

      <h5>The Story Behind It:</h5>

      <p class="small-column">I didn't know if I would ever make another full length sign language music video, but inspiration struck one day as I listened to this song, 'Jesus, Only Jesus', and was overwhelmed by a message that I quickly wrote down:</p>

      <p class="small-column">For all the good that is done in the world, the world is not ours to save. The purpose of life is bigger than even helping others.</p>

      <p class="small-column">It is to know God.</p>

      <p class="small-column">And this is what we most need saving from - our separation from God, our fall into emptiness and death.</p>

      <p class="small-column">But one thing can save us from that, has saved us from that - Hallelujah! - if we accept and grab hold of his hand -</p>

      <p class="small-column">Jesus, only Jesus.</p>

      <p class="small-column">Apart from Jesus, we have no credit to our name for any good.</p>

      <p class="small-column">With Jesus, we have a relationship with God himself, and with God, all the good things thrown in as well.</p>

      <p class="small-column">(Filmed in Austria, Slovenia, Germany, and Czech Republic.  See <a href="http://blog.erikpintar.com/jesus-only-jesus.html" style="display:inline;">this blog post</a> for all the locations this film was shot.)</p>
